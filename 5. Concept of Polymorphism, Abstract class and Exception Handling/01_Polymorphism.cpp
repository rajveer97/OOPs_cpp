Notes:
    Polymorphism:
        The word polymorphism means having many forms.
    
        In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message 
        to be displayed in more than one form. 
        
        A real-life example of polymorphism is that a person at the same time 
        can have different characteristics.

        Like: a man at the same time can be a father, a husband, and an employee.
        So, the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. 
        This is called polymorphism.

        There are 2 types of polymorphism:
            1. Compile time: Function overloading and operator overloading , early binding
            2. Run time: virtual functions, late binding
