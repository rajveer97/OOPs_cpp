    Class and Objects:
        Class and Objects are the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming,

    Class:
        A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which real-world objects are created. 
        It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. 
        We can call class as a collection of objects.

    Object:
        An Object is instance of class. 
        - It has State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. 
        It also reflects the properties of an object. 
        - Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. 
        It also reflects the response of an object with other objects. 
        - Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

    Example:

        Dog class
            state: color, breed, age 
            behavior: bark(), eat(), sleep() 
            identity: BullDog, poddle

        Person class
            state: age, gender, complexion 
            behaviour: think (), sleep(), eat()
            identity: name1, name2
